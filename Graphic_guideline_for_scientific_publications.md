## Guide to prepare figures for scientific publications
> by Pengfei Liu (pengfei.liu@eas.gatech.edu)

### Overview
Figures are an important element of a scientific paper. The aim of this document is to provide a guideline for graduate students and postdocs in my group on how to prepare figures for publications. Note that different journals may have different requirements. However, figures prepared following this guide should work for most of journals.

### What softwares should I use?

I personally use MATLAB and Python for most of the data analysis and visualization (Matlab for experimental datasets and Python for modeling/satellite datasets). For research involving mass spectrometer data, Igor might be very useful. You may use other software (e.g., R) if you like. However, I would recommend to learn at least one programming language (and master it!) other than Excel. I use Adobe Acrobat to make simple edits on PDF files (e.g., adding (a), (b) labels, rearrange panels, etc).

### General guide

Below is the formatting guide for figures from Nature:

> Figures should be as small and simple as is compatible with clarity. The goal is for figures to be comprehensible to readers in other or related disciplines, and to assist their understanding of the paper. Unnecessary figures and parts (panels) of figures should be avoided: data presented in small tables or histograms, for instance, can generally be stated briefly in the text instead. Avoid unnecessary complexity, colouring and excessive detail.

> Figures should not contain more than one panel unless the parts are logically connected; each panel of a multipart figure should be sized so that the whole figure can be reduced by the same amount and reproduced on the printed page at the smallest size at which essential details are visible. For guidance, Natureâ€™s standard figure sizes are 89 mm (single column) and 183 mm (double column) and the full depth of the page is 247 mm.

### Figure size, font, and file format

Always set the paper size (US letter, 8.5" * 11") and figure size in your software. This will ensure that your font size in figures are consistent. It is recommended to plot figures in their actual sizes that appear in publication. For a simple, single panel figure, use single column size (width < 89 mm/3.5" for Nature journals or 3.25" for ACS journals). For complex, multiple-panel figures, you may use double column size (width < 183 mm/7.2" or 7"). The length should be < 9.5" so it fits into a single page US letter paper. 

Use If you plot figures in actual size, font size 8 should be large enough. If you plot the figure 50% larger than actual size (not recommended), use font size 12.
