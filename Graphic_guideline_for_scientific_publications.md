## Guide to prepare figures for scientific publications
#### by Pengfei Liu (pengfei.liu@eas.gatech.edu)

#### Introduction
Figures are an important element of a scientific paper. The aim of this document is to provide a guideline for graduate students and postdocs in my group on how to prepare figures for publications. Note that different journals may have different requirements. However, figures prepared following this guide should work for most of journals.

### What softwares should I use?

I personally use MATLAB and Python for most of the data analysis and visualization (Matlab for experimental datasets and Python for modeling/satellite datasets). For research involving mass spectrometer data, Igor might be very useful. You may use other software (e.g., R) if you like. However, I would recommend to learn at least one programming language (and master it!) other than Excel.

### 

Figures should be as small and simple as is compatible with clarity. The goal is for figures to be comprehensible to readers in other or related disciplines, and to assist their understanding of the paper. Unnecessary figures and parts (panels) of figures should be avoided: data presented in small tables or histograms, for instance, can generally be stated briefly in the text instead. Avoid unnecessary complexity, colouring and excessive detail.
